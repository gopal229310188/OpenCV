Under LAB1.py I have performed basic image handling and processing operations on a test image named as SampleImage.jpeg.

The functions which I have performed are listed below ->
1) Set up OpenCV in Visual Studio Code
2) Read, display and write an image
3) Convert imnage to another format (.jpeg to .png)
4) Resize an image
5) Convert a colored image to grayscale
6) Apply scaling, rotation and shifting to image
7) Play a video using OpenCV
8) Generate an image using a formula

In order to perform the above functions I have installed and imported some libraries in python which are listed below ->
1) Numpy
2) Matplotlib
3) OpenCV

We can perform the operations one by one but I have created a single program for all of them.
Every single task has been defined as a function which will be called depending on the user input.
The user will enter an integer and based on that input a function will be called.
